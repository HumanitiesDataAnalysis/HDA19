To manage problem sets and assignments, we'll be using a piece of software called "git." This will make it easier to keep track of all the files from the course.

http://git-scm.com/

First things first. Here's how you'll get all the example code and problem sets from the course. Install RStudio on your computer.

Go to `File: New Project`: select "Create from version control." And then choose "Clone a project from a Git repository."

You will then be asked for a remote location. Choose the one for this site.

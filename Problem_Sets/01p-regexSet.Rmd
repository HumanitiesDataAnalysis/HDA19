1. The word "picalilli" contains five consecutive "l" or "i" letters. What word contains 6 consecutive "i" or "ls"?
2. What word uses all five vowels, in alphabetical order?
3. Design a regex that replaces the text strings `"NU"` and `"NEU"` with the word "Northeastern."
4. Sometimes documents have excessive spaces in them. Write a regex that reduces any string of spaces down to just one.
5. Write a regex that changes the spelling of all words in a document so that they conform to the rule "I before e, except after c."
6. Michael Witmore writes for this week:

	> One hundred years from now, the available computational objects may be related to one another in new ways. I can only imagine what these are: every fourth word in every fourth document, assuming one could stabilize something like “word length” in any real sense.

	Write a find-replace regex that will reduce a text to every fourth word in every fourth sentence of a given text.

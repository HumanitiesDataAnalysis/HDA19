To manage problem sets and assignments, we'll be using a piece of software called "git." This will make it easier to keep track of all the files from the course.

http://git-scm.com/


First things first. Here's how you'll get all the example code and problem sets from the course. Install RStudio on your computer.

Go to `File: New Project`: select "Create from version control." And then choose "Clone a project from a Git repository."

You will then be asked for a remote location. Choose


That will ask for a URL 



```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
